- ðŸ”­ Pytheca is an interface that searches, finds and executes Python modules and displays the output in a Mathematica like style. The modules are stores in a package folder en subfolders (one level deep). As I said the interface behaves somewhat like Mathematica, but also like a modern calculator. Modules will be added by me, but Python programmers can also submit modules. The areas in which this app and accompanying package can be used are versatile: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, statistics. The list is basically endless.

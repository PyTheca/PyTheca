### Hi there, welcome to Pytheca. ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Pytheca is an interface that searches, finds and executes Python modules and displays the output in a Mathematica like style. 
- The modules are stores in a package folder en subfolders (one level deep).
- As I said the interface behaves somewhat like Mathematica, but also like a modern calculator.
- Modules will be added by me, but Python programmers can also submit modules.
